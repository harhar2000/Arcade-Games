# Arcade Simulator

This project is an arcade game simulator that plays a sequence of classic games: **Pong**, **Asteroid**, and **Pacman**. After each game finishes, the next one in the sequence is automatically launched.

## Features
- Sequential game-playing functionality: Pong → Asteroid → Pacman
- Smooth transition between games
- Modular code structure for easy maintenance and updates
- Code designed using object-oriented principles

## Requirements
To run the arcade simulator, you need the following:
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

Install the requirements using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Clone this Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arcade-simulator.git
```

Navigate to the Project Directory:
```bash
cd arcade-simulator
```

Install Required Libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the arcade simulator, go to the pong folder and use the following command:
```bash 
python main.py
```

# Arcade Simulator

This simulator features three classic arcade games: Pong, Asteroid, and Pacman. Once a game ends, the simulator will automatically transition to the next one in sequence.

## Game Sequence

1. **Pong**
2. **Asteroid**
3. **Pacman**

## Game Descriptions

### Pong
Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The game consists of two paddles, with a ball bouncing between them. Players score points by sending the ball past their opponent's paddle.

### Asteroid
In Asteroid, the player controls a spaceship that must navigate through space, avoiding or shooting down asteroids. The goal is to survive and destroy as many asteroids as possible without being hit.

### Pacman
Pacman is a maze game where the player controls Pacman, who must eat all the dots in the maze while avoiding being caught by ghosts. Power pellets allow Pacman to temporarily eat the ghosts for extra points.
